          I am passionate about problem-solving and finding the most efficient, elegant solutions rather than just any solution. I am particularly fascinated by the development of AI and how it can be leveraged to make the world a better place. I enjoy exploring systems at a low level to understand how they work internally and thrive on learning deeply enough that I can teach others, because teaching strengthens my own understanding. Helping people and sharing knowledge is one of my core motivations, and I strive to combine curiosity, technical skill, and empathy in everything I do.
